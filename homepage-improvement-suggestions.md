# Homepage Improvement Suggestions

## Visual Hierarchy
- **Make mission goals more prominent** - Consider larger text or better styling since they're key messaging
- **Highlight "The K9 Family" card** - Make it stand out more as it's likely the primary action users should take
- **Improve mission section styling** - Currently feels bare without background, could use subtle styling or borders

## Content Flow & Organization
- **Mission section integration** - Better visual connection between mission and surrounding content
- **Consistent section spacing** - Ensure all sections have harmonious spacing relationships

## Mobile Experience
- **Optimize tablet layout** - Consider 2 columns on tablet instead of 3 for better card proportions
- **Mobile mission spacing** - Mission text might need better spacing on smaller screens
- **Touch-friendly interactions** - Ensure all interactive elements are appropriately sized

## Interactive Elements
- **Mission bullet animations** - Add hover states or subtle animations to the mission bullets
- **Logo interactivity** - Consider making the logo clickable to return home (standard UX pattern)
- **Card hover enhancements** - Current cards have good hover effects, could be refined further

## Content Optimization
- **Streamline welcome text** - Current intro paragraph is quite long, could be more concise and impactful
- **Punchier mission goals** - Mission statements could be shorter and more memorable
- **Clearer value propositions** - Each card description could be even more action-oriented

## Technical Improvements
- **Accessibility** - Add focus states and improve keyboard navigation
- **Performance** - Optimize images and consider lazy loading for better performance
- **SEO** - Add proper meta descriptions and structured data

## Future Considerations
- **Personalization** - Could show different content based on user status (new vs returning)
- **Analytics** - Track which cards are clicked most to inform future improvements
- **A/B testing** - Test different card arrangements and copy variations
