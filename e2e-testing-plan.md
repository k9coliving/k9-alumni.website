# E2E Testing Plan: Checkly Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to implement end-to-end (e2e) testing for the K9 Alumni website using Checkly for synthetic monitoring and scheduled health checks.

## Why Checkly?

- **Purpose-built for production monitoring** - Designed specifically for scheduled health checks rather than deployment-gated tests
- **Playwright-based** - Uses familiar Playwright syntax under the hood
- **Multi-location monitoring** - Can run tests from different geographic locations
- **Excellent alerting** - Built-in notifications via email, Slack, SMS, etc.
- **Great developer experience** - Easy setup, good UI, detailed debugging tools
- **Free tier available** - Good for getting started

## Test Coverage Plan

#### 1. Authentication Flow Test
**Purpose:** Ensure the site's password protection is working correctly

**Test Steps:**
- Navigate to home page
- Verify password form is displayed
- Enter the correct site password
- Submit the form
- Verify successful authentication (redirected to protected content)
- Check that JWT cookie is set

**Failure Impact:** CRITICAL - Users cannot access the site

---

#### 2. Invalid Authentication Test
**Purpose:** Ensure password protection rejects invalid passwords

**Test Steps:**
- Navigate to home page
- Enter an incorrect password
- Verify error message is displayed
- Verify user remains on login page
- Verify no JWT cookie is set

**Failure Impact:** HIGH - Security vulnerability if failing

---

#### 3. Protected Page Access Test
**Purpose:** Verify authenticated users can access all protected pages

**Test Steps:**
- Authenticate with valid password
- Navigate to each main page:
  - `/who-are-we`
  - `/thek9family`
  - `/events`
  - `/newsletter`
  - `/tips`
  - `/holdmyhair`
  - `/relocation`
- Verify each page loads successfully (no 401/403 errors)
- Verify navigation menu is present and functional

**Failure Impact:** HIGH - Core functionality broken

---

#### 4. K9 Family Directory Test
**Purpose:** Ensure the alumni directory loads and displays data correctly

**Test Steps:**
- Authenticate with valid password
- Navigate to `/thek9family`
- Verify resident cards are displayed (check for at least 1 card)
- Test search functionality:
  - Enter a search term
  - Verify results filter appropriately
- Test tag filtering (if applicable)
- Click on a resident card
- Verify detail view/modal opens with information

**Failure Impact:** HIGH - Core feature of the site
