# K9 Alumni Website

Whether you've been a K9er for a few months or many years, moving out is never easy. We are on a journey to build a strong alumni network, so the K9 magic lives on, outside the walls of the house.

This is a password-protected alumni community website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

> **Note**: This project is shared publicly to take advantage of free hosting tiers (Vercel's Next.js free tier). It is not intended as a reusable open source project and will not be maintained as such. The code is specific to our K9 alumni community needs.

## Features

- **Password Protection**: Secure access with shared password authentication
- **Session Management**: JWT-based authentication that persists across browser sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
- **Supabase Integration**: PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
